# Python Operators

Python operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. The main types include:

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform basic mathematical operations.
```python
x, y = 10, 5
print(x + y, x - y, x * y, x / y, x % y, x ** y, x // y)
```

## 2. Assignment Operators
Assign values with shorthand operations.
```python
x = 10
x += 5  # x = x + 5
print(x)
```

## 3. Comparison Operators
Compare values.
```python
x, y = 10, 5
print(x == y, x != y, x > y, x < y)
```

## 4. Logical Operators
Used for conditional logic.
```python
x, y = True, False
print(x and y, x or y, not x)
```

## 5. Identity Operators
Check if two variables refer to the same object.
```python
a, b = [1, 2], [1, 2]
print(a is b, a is not b)
```

## 6. Membership Operators
Check for membership in a sequence.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(2 in numbers, 5 not in numbers)
```

## 7. Bitwise Operators
Perform operations at the binary level.
```python
a, b = 5, 3
print(a & b, a | b, a ^ b, ~a, a << 1, a >> 1)
```

Mastering these operators enhances coding efficiency.
